Imagine if /r9k/EiS had been planned out from the beginning instead of just being a collection of one shot prompts that took on a life of their own. Add in ice powers (which make everything more interesting) and you basically have Tessellate. While it takes a more focused, controlled approach to the angst compared to EiS's blunt sledgehammer of feels, this is a deeply emotional fic that will leave you begging for some fluff.",
