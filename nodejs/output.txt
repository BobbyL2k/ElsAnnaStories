Anna and Elsa grew up playing together, despite being princesses from different kingdoms. They are to be married as a result of a betrothal arranged years earlier, before the death of Arendelle's king and queen. This story neatly side-steps the social acceptability, and morality issues that tend to bog down so many Elsanna fics. Instead it is free to focus on the two girls, their desires and insecurities, and what a relationship between them really means.|http://archiveofourown.org/works/1136739|https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10023938/1/A-Formal-Arrangement|

Imagine if /r9k/EiS had been planned out from the beginning instead of just being a collection of one shot prompts that took on a life of their own. Add in ice powers (which make everything more interesting) and you basically have Tessellate. While it takes a more focused, controlled approach to the angst compared to EiS's blunt sledgehammer of feels, this is a deeply emotional fic that will leave you begging for some fluff.||https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10155342/1/Tessellate|

As much as Elsa and Anna are sure they love each other unconditionally, they don't really know each other, or even really themselves. When they start figuring out how to open up they might find more than they expected. The eloquence of the writing in this fic is matched only by the author's clear understanding of the sisters and their deep-seated insecurities. It's still early on in what promises to be a long story, but there's already so much heart and emotion in just these few chapters.|http://archiveofourown.org/works/1603178/chapters/3411962?view_adult=true||

But some feelings, some addictions, can't be so easily dismissed, especially when those addictions feel the same way. If Tessellate is EiS's better structured cousin, then this fic is the incredibly smutty version. I had considered putting this in the smut section but decided that wouldn't do justice to the superbly crafted substance and emotion behind all the sex. Also, it's written by the author of Lying Here With You, and the contrast between the tone and content of the two stories is hilarious.||https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10149159/1/The-Lies-We-Tell-Ourselves|
