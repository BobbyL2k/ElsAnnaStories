    "Detail":"Elsa thought she could ignore it, make it go away, make her go away. But some feelings, some addictions, can't be so easily dismissed, especially when those addictions feel the same way. If Tessellate is EiS's better structured cousin, then this fic is the incredibly smutty version. I had considered putting this in the smut section but decided that wouldn't do justice to the superbly crafted substance and emotion behind all the sex. Also, it's written by the author of Lying Here With You, and the contrast between the tone and content of the two stories is hilarious.",
